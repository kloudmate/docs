description: Configure notification channels to receive KloudMate alerts via Slack, PagerDuty, email, and more.
---

Alert channels define where KloudMate sends notifications when an alert fires. You can configure one or more channels per workspace.

## Supported channels

| Channel | Description |
|---|---|
| Slack | Post messages to a Slack channel or DM |
| PagerDuty | Create PagerDuty incidents automatically |
| Email | Send email to one or more addresses |
| Webhook | POST a JSON payload to any HTTP endpoint |
| OpsGenie | Create OpsGenie alerts |

## Prerequisites

- Admin or Editor role in KloudMate

## Steps

### 1. Open channel settings

Go to **Settings → Alert channels**.

### 2. Click Add channel

Select **Add channel** and choose your channel type.

### 3. Provide credentials

Enter the required credentials (for example, a Slack webhook URL or a PagerDuty integration key).

### 4. Test the connection

Click **Test** to send a test notification and verify the channel is working.

### 5. Save the channel

Click **Save**. The channel is now available when creating alert rules.

## Troubleshooting

If the test notification does not arrive, check that credentials are correct and that outbound network access is allowed to the destination service.
