description: Connect KloudMate to your cloud platforms, services, and data sources.
---

KloudMate supports integrations with the most popular cloud platforms, container orchestration systems, and observability standards. Each integration guide walks you through the setup steps specific to that platform.

## Available integrations

| Integration | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [AWS](/docs/integrations/aws) | Cloud | Ingest CloudWatch metrics, logs, and events |
| [Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes) | Container orchestration | Monitor clusters, nodes, and pods |
| [OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry) | Standard | Send traces, metrics, and logs via OTLP |

## How integrations work

Each integration connects KloudMate to a data source using one of:

- **Read access** (for example, AWS IAM role for CloudWatch)
- **Agent deployment** (for example, KloudMate Kubernetes agent)
- **SDK / exporter configuration** (for example, OpenTelemetry OTLP endpoint)

## Prerequisites

- A KloudMate workspace
- Admin or Editor role
