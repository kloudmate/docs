Dashboard variables let you create dynamic dashboards where a single dashboard can be filtered by environment, region, service, or any other dimension without duplicating panels.

## How variables work

You define a variable at the dashboard level. Panels use the variable in their queries with the syntax `$variable_name`. When a viewer changes the variable value using the dropdown at the top of the dashboard, all panels update automatically.

## Steps

### 1. Open dashboard settings

In a dashboard, click the settings icon (gear) in the top-right corner.

### 2. Add a variable

Go to the **Variables** tab and click **Add variable**.

### 3. Configure the variable

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | The variable identifier (for example, `service`) |
| Type | **Query** (from data), **Custom** (static list), or **Constant** |
| Query | For query type, write the query that returns the variable values |

### 4. Use the variable in panels

In your panel queries, reference the variable with `$service` (replacing `service` with your variable name).

## Troubleshooting

If a variable dropdown is empty, verify that the query or static list is correctly configured and the data source is responding.
