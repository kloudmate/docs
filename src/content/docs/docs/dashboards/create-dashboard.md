This guide shows you how to create a new dashboard and add panels to visualise your data.

## Prerequisites

- At least one data source connected

## Steps

### 1. Go to Dashboards

In the left navigation, select **Dashboards** and click **New dashboard**.

### 2. Add a panel

Click **Add panel** and choose a panel type:

- **Time series** for metric graphs
- **Single stat** for KPIs
- **Log list** for recent log entries

### 3. Configure the data source

In the panel editor, select the data source and write your query. For metrics, choose a metric name and aggregation. For logs, enter a filter query.

### 4. Set the visualisation options

Adjust the chart type, axis labels, colour scheme, and display units to suit your use case.

### 5. Arrange panels

Drag panels to reorder them. Resize by dragging the bottom-right corner.

### 6. Save the dashboard

Click **Save dashboard**, give it a name, and optionally add a description.

## Troubleshooting

If a panel shows "No data", confirm the data source is connected and your query returns results in the selected time range.
